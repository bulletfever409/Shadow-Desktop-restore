So I've seen a few people ask about when you re-open shadow after a while without shutting down and the desktop not working/being there.

I think (but don't quote me on this) it's when in a way, your place on the servers has been reset and you're giving a new part of the server to work on.

Anyway, I discovered that some people have been restarting shadow etc when they don't need to. All it takes is a simple explorer.exe restart. As opening task manager, finding explorer and then restarting can be time consuming I've made myself a simple batch file that will do it for you as well as a shortcut file.

The shortcut file will open the batch file and reset as it should but the benefit to using a shortcut as well means you can add it to the start menu making it just easier and faster to do so.


To Install just put both files into your Local Disk C:/ drive.

To add the shortcut to the start menu, right click it and click "pin to start"
